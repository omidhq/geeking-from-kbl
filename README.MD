# GIT exercise:

Here is what you need to do for this exercise:

1. Clone this repository 
1. Create a branch called `your-name` (e.g. `omid-hq`)
1. Write your name at the end of the `TheDevs.md` file
1. Stage and commit the change to your repository
1. Push the change to the remote
1. Create a pull request
1. Wait for the request to be approved.

### Instructions:
- Make sure you have Git installed on your computer. [You can get the latest version (for macOS, Linux, Windows, etc.) here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Make sure you have authenticated with GitHub from Git. [Here is one resource (among many on the Internet) on how to authenticate with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git#authenticating-with-github-from-git)
- It's better to use a code editor (e.g. VS Code, Atom, Sublime Text 3, etc.) to edit the Markdown file (aka `.md` files) in this exercise. If you don't have a code editor already, I recommend working with VS Code. [You can download it here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Tips:
- Use the internet to your benefit when you face an error. Finding the right answer in an ocean of resources like the internet is a skill in itself.

_Happy geeking aka learning!_

Good luck! Have fun!
