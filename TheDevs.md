# The exercise

Do as told in steps 1 and 2 of the `README.md`â€”`clone` the repo and create a branch. Then, in this file, add your name and a quote below to say you were here.

Finally `push` it with a meaningful `commit` message, send a `pull request`. I'll `merge` your branch into the main branch after you are done. The magic happens there and then!
